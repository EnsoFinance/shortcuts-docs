## GET /v1/shortcuts/quote

If the EoA doesn't hold enough funds or allowance to execute the transaction, the route endpoint won't be able to calculate the best route.

The quote endpoint is a fast way to get the amount of tokenOut that will be received, without the need of holding the funds or allowance.
